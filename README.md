# War_in_Rust

MVP of this program is a simple simulator of the card game War done in rust as a way to playfully explore the language. Simply adjust the random number generator params in the code to get a different shuffle of the deck, hit run, and read the output of the game.

- Uses the shuffle crate to shuffle the cards.
- 1 (Ace) is the low card, 13 (King) is the high card
- suits and card names are not implemented, only the values
